## Vim Yank Bank

Lightweight vim plugin for preserving yanks and system clipboard into named registers without altering the default vim behavior. It works by creating a backup to an arbitrary number of registers specified by the user which are used to rotate the last 'n' yanks and clipboard yanks.
